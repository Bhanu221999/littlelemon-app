# Expo App Project 📱

## Overview
This is a cross-platform mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), a powerful framework for creating universal React Native apps. The project was bootstrapped using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) to ensure best practices and optimal setup.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator (for Mac users) or Android Studio (for Android development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhanu221999/littlelemon-app.git
cd littlelemon-app
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npx expo start
```

## 📱 Running the App

After starting the development server, you have several options to run the app:

- 📱 **Expo Go** (Recommended for quick testing)
  - Install Expo Go on your physical device
  - Scan the QR code from the terminal
  
- 🤖 **Android Emulator**
  - Press 'a' in the terminal
  - Make sure Android Studio and an emulator are set up
  
- 🍎 **iOS Simulator** (Mac only)
  - Press 'i' in the terminal
  - Requires Xcode installed

- 💻 **Development Build**
  - For advanced features and custom native code

## 📂 Project Structure

- `app/` - Main application code (uses file-based routing)
- `assets/` - Static assets like images and fonts
- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `app-example/` - Example code (after reset)

## 🔄 Starting Fresh

To remove the example code and start with a clean slate:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This will:
- Move starter code to `app-example/`
- Create a fresh `app/` directory
- Set up a blank canvas for your project
